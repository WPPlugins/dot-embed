3. If you have any questions or need help, just reach out to us at [dot.vu](https://dot.vu).

== Installation ==

= Automatic installation =
Automatic installation is the easiest option as WordPress handles the file transfers itself and you don’t need to leave your web browser. To do an automatic install of Dot Embed, log in to your WordPress dashboard, navigate to the Plugins menu and click Add New.

In the search field type “Dot Embed” and click *Search Plugins*. Once you’ve found our Dot Embed plugin, you can install it by simply clicking “Install Now”.

= Manual installation =
The manual installation method involves [downloading our plugin](https://4500902784af655b3de3-5ad26d8a78e52ca19e00dd2d340c77bb.ssl.cf3.rackcdn.com/Plugins/dotembed.zip) and uploading it to your webserver via your favourite FTP application. The WordPress codex contains [instructions on how to do this here](http://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Manual_Plugin_Installation).

= Updating =
Automatic updates should work like a charm, no worries there.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I use this code on other platforms? =
